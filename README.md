Introduction
Welcome to my Bellabeat data analysis case study! In this case study, I will perform real-world tasks of a
data analyst. And in order to answer some key business questions, I will follow the steps of the data analysis
process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.

Scenario of the study
In this study, I will focus on one of Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into
how consumers are using their smart devices. The insights will then help guide marketing strategy for the
company



Questions for the Analysis (Ask phase)
In this phase, I tried to better undestand the data and the problem I’m trying to solve. And to do that, I
had to do more research and ask more questions.
• What are some trends in smart device usage? How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing
strategy ? So first, the company need to better target their marketing efforts into their customer’s
needs based on their usage of their fitness smart devices. And then, make high-level recommendations
for how these trends can inform Bellabeat marketing strategy.
• Who are the main stakeholders ? The main stakeholders are Urška Sršen, Bellabeat’s co-founder and
Chief Creative Officer; Sando Mur, Mathematician and Bellabeat’s cofounder;And also, we need to
think about and work with the rest of the Bellabeat marketing analytics team. 




Business Task
Now, after getting answers to all of my questions (during the ask phase), I’m able to define clearly the
business task which is: To analyse how do Bellabeat customers use their smart devices? And then, Identify
potential opportunities for growth and recommendations for the Bellabeat marketing team based on trends
in smart device usage.


Conclusions & Recommandations for the Business
So, collecting data on activity, sleep, stress, etc. will allow the company Bellabeat to empower the customers
with knowledge about their own health and daily habits. The company Bellabeat is growing rapidly and
quickly positioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for their customers.
By analyzing the FitBit Fitness Tracker Data set, I found some insights that would help influence Bellabeat
marketing strategy.




Target Audience:
People working full-time jobs and spending a lot of time at the computer and in the office and need fitness
and daily activities to be in shape.
The users are doing some light activity to stay healthy (according to the activity type analysis). And they
need to improve their everyday activity to have more health benefits. And they might need some knowledge
about developing healthy habits and motivation to keep them going.





Message to the Company
The Bellabeat app need to be a unique fitness activity app. By becoming a companion guide (like a friend)
to its users and customers and help them balance their personal and professional life with healthy habits.

Recommendations to the Bellabeat Marketing team
• The average sedentary time is too high for the users of the app (more than 16 hours). And definitely
needs to be reduced with a good marketing strategy. So, the data shows that the company need to
market more to the customer segment with a high Sedentary time. And to do that, the company needs
to find ways to get customers started in walking more by measuring their daily steps (+ notifications).
• Participants sleep 1 time for an average of 7 hours. To help users improve their sleep, Bellabeat should
consider using app notifications to go to bed. And also, the Bellabeat app can recommend reducing
sedentary time for its customers.
• The average total steps per day (which is 7638) is a little bit less than recommended by the CDC.
According to the CDC research, taking 8,000 steps per day was associated with a 51% lower risk for
all-cause mortality (or death from all causes). And taking 12,000 steps per day was associated with a
65% lower risk compared with taking 4,000 steps. So, Bellabeat can encourage people to take at least
8,000 steps per day by explaining the healthy benefits of doing that.
• By analysing the Intensity data over time. The company will have a good idea on how their customers
are using their app during the day. Most users are actif before and after work. The company can use
this time in the Bellabeat app to remind and motivate users to go for a run or for a walk.
• For customers who want to lose weight, it can be a good idea to control daily calorie consumption. And
Bellabeat can suggest some ideas for low-calorie healthy food (for lunch and dinner).
